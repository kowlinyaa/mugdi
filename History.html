Though Mugdi is a small and relatively unknown village, it holds great historical importance. It is believed that a river channel once flowed through the village but eventually disappeared over time. The area was also known for severe flooding, and boat racing was a major activity during those times. With proper maintenance efforts, the flood problem has now been almost completely resolved. Beyond its geography, Mugdi has welcomed many notable personalities from the past, such as Bishnu Prasad Rabha and Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, which reflects the villageâ€™s historical prominence. The presence of these figures, along with its heritage sites, shows that the village has a long and rich past. The main temple was built over a century ago and renovated around 18 years ago. Additionally, the village is home to an ancient Shiva temple and several very old ponds. One triangular pond, believed to symbolize the three Supas of the village, stands as a remarkable example. The Sobha of Mugdi is also recognized as one of the oldest in Assam, further highlighting its cultural and historical legacy.The High School in Mugdi was established in 1963, marking a significant milestone in the village's educational history. This institution has played a crucial role in shaping the minds of many generations, contributing to the overall development and progress of the community. The establishment of the High School reflects the village's commitment to education and its importance in fostering growth and opportunity for its residents.
