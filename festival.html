However, in the last two years, all three supas have begun celebrating the festival together, strengthening community bonds and making the celebrations more vibrant.<br><b>Kati Bihu: </b>Kati Bihu is celebrated separately in both supas, though the rituals remain quite similar. Throughout the month of Kati, Nam Kirtan is performed daily at the public temples in both areas, bringing together devotees in spiritual gatherings.<br><b>Magh Bihu: </b>Magh Bihu is celebrated in the traditional way, staying true to documented customs. Both supas invite performers such as Nagra Man, local drama (Natok), and sometimes singers to enhance the festive spirit and bring entertainment to the community.<br>Through these celebrations, Mugdi continues to preserve its cultural heritage and strengthen ties among its diverse community.
