       <p class="paragraph">Mugdi is a rural settlement situated in the Barkhetri subdivision of Nalbari district, Assam. The village lies about 30 kilometers from Nalbari town, which serves as both the district and sub-divisional headquarters, providing administrative and commercial support to the region. Administratively, Mugdi falls under the jurisdiction of the Mugdi Rampur Gram Panchayat and is recorded with the official village code 303716. It spans a geographical area of approximately 144 hectares and is served by the postal code 781312. While it remains closely connected to Nalbari for essential services and governance, Mugdi retains the character of a quiet rural settlement, embedded within the agrarian landscape of Barkhetri. Its location thus combines accessibility with the distinct cultural and natural environment of Assamâ€™s countryside.
