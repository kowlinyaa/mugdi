       <p class="paragraph">Mugdi is a quiet and naturally beautiful village in Assamâ€™s Nalbari district, carrying with it the peaceful rhythm of rural life and the essence of Assamese culture. The village is surrounded by greenery and open landscapes, where people live closely connected to nature and community. One of the unique features of Mugdi is that it is divided into three main parts, locally known as supa. These are Puran Supa, Notun Supa, and Boro Supa, each of which adds its own importance to the identity of the village. Puran Supa represents the older portion of Mugdi, where the roots of settlement lie and traditions remain strong. Notun Supa, as its name suggests, is the newer extension, showing how the village has grown and adapted over time. Boro Supa holds a special place as it is home to the Boro tribe, the largest tribe of Assam, whose presence brings a unique cultural flavor and diversity to Mugdi. Together, these three supas not only give the village its structure but also reflect a balance between tradition, growth, and community life. Mugdi, with its calm environment, cultural richness, and sense of unity, stands as a village that beautifully blends simplicity with diversity, making it both rooted in the past and open to the present.<br> According to Census 2011, the location code or village code of Mugdi is 303716. The village spans a total geographical area of 144.37 hectares, and the pincode of the locality is 781312. Nalbari is nearest town to Mugdi village for all major economic activities, which is approximately 30km away.
